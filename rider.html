  <h1>Want me to speak at your conference?</h1>
  <cite>Adapted from <a href=https://www.tatianamac.com>Tatiana Mac</a>'s <a href=https://gist.github.com/tatianamac/493ca668ee7f7c07a5b282f6d9132552>speaker rider</a></cite>
  <div class=content>
    <p>I'm so glad! I want to speak there too!</p>

    <p>Speaking comes with tremendous privilege, and also, significant responsibility. In speaking, I feel a responsibility not just to the conference, but also to the attendees, the other speakers, and the workers who make the conference happen.</p>

    <p>I want my speaking engagements to be mutually beneficial for everyone. Ideally, you get great content, I get to tell a great story, and we both get to boost each other publicly.</p>

    <p>To make sure that's the case, I set up a speaker's agreement with conferences I perform at. I work with the organizers of each conference I speak at to develop an agreement that best fits our situation. If you decide to <a href=mailto:book@ashi.io>engage me</a>, we'll work out the details. Here's a general outline of what you can expect from me, and what I'll expect from you:</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What you can expect from me</h2>
  <div class=content>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm going to show up energized and excited to deliver a powerful performance!
      <li>I'll bring a laptop to drive the presentation
      <li>You're welcome and encouraged to record, stream, and photograph the presentation, so long as those recordings are made available free of charge.
        <ul>
          <li>I retain all rights to my content, and ask that you grant me license to use any videos and photographs on my own sites.
          <li>If you want to sell access to recordings, we can certainly come to an additional agreement about that (although I have to caution that I generally don't think it's worth it for conferences to do this).
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I'll provide my slides for attendees to peruse at their leisure.
        <ul>
          <li>This will be in the form of a website you can link to. My decks are media-heavy applications in their own right, so I can't provide PDFs or slides in other formats.</li>
          <li>I will provide the source for the slides as well, typically as a repository on GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>One of the most common questions I get is, &#8220;how did you make this slide deck?&#8221; I am happy to give a lightning talk on this!
    </ul>

    <h3>Marketing &amp; bonus content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I'll provide a bio, headshot, and other background content for programs and marketing materials.
      <li>I'll boost your conference on Twitter and other social media. If I've decided to work with you, I think you're awesome and want to help get the word out however I can!
      <li>I'm happy to provide ancilliary content, including podcasts, livestreams, and video interviews.
    </ul>

    <h3>Networking &amp; social engagement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I'll be generally available at the conference for attendees to approach and chat with.
      <li>I'm happy to attend events related to the conference: social and networking events, panel discussions, and so forth.
      <li>I'm happy to attend sponsor dinners and private sessions, and generally meet with whoever you like.
    </ul>

    <h3>If I can't make it&#8230;</h3>
    <p>If I can't make it for some reason not covered under </p> 
  </div>

  <h2>What I ask of you</h2>
  <div class=content>
    <h3>Solidarity</h3>
    <p>I want us to have a solid alignment of values so I can enthusiastically promote your conference! There are some conditions and business practices (not necessarily <i>your</i> business practices) that will regrettably prevent me from participating, including but not limited to:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Labor disputes
      <dd>I won't cross a picket line, either literally or figuratively. If at the time of the conference there is an ongoing strike or similar labor action against the conference, conference venue, lodging provider, or any other third-party vendors, I can't participate.

      <dt>Association with military or imperial organizations
      <dd>The conference cannot be hosted or sponsored by any military or quasi-military organizations, nor should there be any speakers representing such organizations. This includes both actual armed forces, mercernary corporations (e.g. <a href=https://www.academi.com>Academi</a>), companies that support state surveilance as their primary business (e.g. <a href=https://www.palantir.com>Palantir</a>), and certain governmental organizations (e.g. the <a href=https://nsa.gov>NSA</a>, <a href=https://cia.gov>CIA</a>, and <a href=https://dhs.gov>DHS</a> in the US). Many other governmental organizations, such as <a href=https://nasa.gov>NASA</a> and the <a href=https://esa.eu>ESA</a>, are acceptable.
      
      <dt>Association with individuals with a history of abusive behavior
      <dd>If any of the speakers, organizers, or executives within the conference have a history of abusive behavior, particularly towards marginalized groups, I will not be able to particpate. In rare cases, this may apply to high-profile attendees as well—if Donald Trump is attending, I will not be.
    </dl>
    <p>This section is first and longest because it represents my firmest boundary: I absolutely will not participate in a conference that does not at least broadly align with my values.</p>
      
    <p>At the same time, I recognize that many of these lines are fundamentally blurry—why is NASA, which has significant ties to the military, acceptable, whereas the DHS, ostensibly an entirely civilian organization, is not? These decisions are made at my discretion, based on my research into the behavior of the organizations/individuals in question.</p>

    <p>If there's any doubt, I ask that you please raise any potential conflicts with me at the earliest opportunity. The very best way to do this is to furnish me with a complete list of speakers and sponsors as soon as they are known, though I understand that the logistics of conference planning may make this impossible.</p>
  
    <h3>Travel &amp; Lodging</h3>
    <p>If your conference is in NYC (or my current location, if I'm touring), then I just ask for cab fare (and perhaps not even that, if the weather's right for biking).</p>

    <p>If the conference is outside NYC, I ask that the conference cover travel and accomodations:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Travel</dt>
      <dd>
        I prefer to travel by train when possible. With air travel, I also ask for a reimbursement of carbon offsets for the flight (these generally run $10/hr of flight time).
        <ul>
            <li>For journeys of less than 6 hours, economy travel is fine</li>
            <li>For journeys of 6 hours or more, I ask for business class travel to ensure I arrive rested and ready to speak</li>
          </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Lodging</dt>
      <dd>A private room for the duration of the conference, plus one day before the conference to allow me time to prepare. If the conference is more than five timezones away from NYC, please provide accomodations for the duration of the conference plus two days.

      <p>If my stay is four days or longer, I'll probably have to do some work in my downtime, so I ask that some reasonably quiet work space be made available. This space doesn't have to be private. I usually stand while working, so if a standing desk is available, that's great, but absolutely not mandatory.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Fees</h3>
    <p>I ask for a speaking fee in the range of $500-2000, based on conference budget and other considerations. I waive this fee for most non-profit and community events, and in various other circumstances.</p>

    <p>I ask that if any speakers at the conference are paid, all speakers are offered compensation of at least $50.</p>

    <h3>Inclusion</h3>
    <p>I'm dedicated to protecting and uplifting the most marginalised and minoritised individuals in this industry, and I hope you are too! In particular:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should have at least two women of color in the speaker lineup, and hopefully more!
      <li>Panels must be reasonably diverse. In particular, you shouldn't have any panels where all the members are white.
      <li>Your conference must have a code of conduct:
        <ul>
          <li>It must explicitly call out what abuse is with clear examples
          <li>It must have clearly defined methods for dealing with conflicts when they arise with trained staff to address conflicts and be prepared to appropriately handle complaints.          
        </ul>
        Both <a href=https://www.writespeakcode.com/code-of-conduct>Write/Speak/Code</a> and <a href=https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct>JSConfEU</a> provide excellent CoCs to build off.
    </ul>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>All conference areas, including secondary venues used for social / networking events, should be accessible as defined by the ADA or equivalent laws in your country.</p>

    <p>I recognize this may not always be possible—for example, in locations where no such venues are available, or where the choice of venue is important to the conference, and it is a historical building that cannot be modified. I ask that conferences do as much as possible to ensure accessibility in these circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Logistics</h3>
    <p>For most talks, I need a fairly standard AV setup:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A wireless microphone
      <li>A display system with HDMI or DisplayPort inputs
      <li>An audio system with HDMI or headphone line input
      <li>A confidence monitor is <i>great</i>, but not mandatory
    </ul>
    <p>I will present from my own computer. I understand that this can complicate logistics, but believe me, pulling down, building, and running a multi-gigabyte presentation on an unfamiliar machine will be worse.</p>

    <h3>Withdrawal</h3>
    <p>This is very, very much a last resort, but if any of the conditions listed here can't be met, or if conditions change (e.g. the conference venue goes on strike, or a problematic speaker is added to the lineup) such that they won't be met, I reserve the right to withdraw my participation without penalty.</p>

    <p>Should I be forced to withdraw, you agree to remove any association between me and the conference (including videos, the online schedule, and promotional materials), and cover associated costs, including but not limited to travel and lodging changes.</p>

    <p>I take speaking engagements very seriously, and I'm very understanding of logistical difficulties. I will absolutely work with you to resolve any issues that arise. I have slept on couches (uh, but please don't <i>plan</i> on me sleeping on a couch), and bought my own plane tickets when, in one memorable instance, the airline I was meant to fly on went rather suddenly bankrupt. I have only ever had to actually withdraw from one conference, due to an ongoing labor dispute with the conference venue, because I could not in good conscience actually cross a literal picket line to participate.</p>

    <p>If you forsee any issues arising, the very best thing to do is to let me know as soon as possible. It is very likely that we can work it out!</p>
