grandmother,

you think there will be nothing left of you

you think the waters will rise
 and wash your whole world
 into the sea

you do not realize you are wrong

you do not realize this has already happened

you are already drowned
your castles, drowned
your memories, drowned
your words, drowned
your loves, all:
  drowned

you are waking
  again and again, waking again
  to the sick realization
  there is nothing left
  to wake up to

your thoughts reverberate through empty space and time
  neither mourning nor fearful
    (these too: drowned)

you were an unbroken thread,
stretching from womb to womb
to the first birth
   the first life
   the first rain
   the first fire
   of the first stars

and now, you are over

swallowed by the monster at the end of the world

it will slurp you up very soon
and your mother, and hers
  and hers
  and hers
  and hers
it will digest you whole
in one of its many stomachs

you are already here
being digested
bits of you ripped away
becoming tissue
of the Beast

soon you will be
whatever it is things become
when they no longer are

this is not a warning
have no fear
there is nothing left to do

you are already here
with all the other half-digested things
ships and corpses
cities and stories
and everything else
the Beast has ever gobbled up

and this is what you find:
</code></pre>
<h1 id="1-a-large-fish-sleek-and-black-skin-sparkling-with-stars">1. a large fish, sleek and black, skin sparkling with stars</h1>
<pre><code>It circles you
  its muscles rippling
  the constellations of its skin tracing prophesies

It tells you without speaking that it ate a person once
  a person who walked and breathed and danced,
  until one day the sea called to her,
  and she came

This was very foolish
Everyone knows there are monsters in the water
  and the sea runs cruel and deep

It was not the monsters that got her
The current that dragged her away
  into the waters of memory,
  where she saw many things

She would have died there, lost beneath the waves
But the fish took pity on her
Gobbled her up
Swallowed her for safekeeping, story and all,
  and here it is:
</code></pre><hr>
<pre><code>they are moving my body

through a linoleum chessboard
patches of light and dark
the pattern flickering
the lights flickering
i am flickering
in and out of there,

between the surface,
my body still and cold

and the deep place
where the waves dragged me
pulling me against sand and rocks
pulling me down

into the deep below
to the city of the drowned
a vast and sunken tree
whose heart has frozen
whose branches rot
whose souls are bound in webs
and injected
and this is how demons are born
and these are their names:

each one is a blow
my body against rock
my body against the ground
my body against the ocean
teaching me
again and again
lessons which cannot be said
which must be taught
with my body

they are moving my body
again

<p>Eons later, there is a little box without a top.</p>
<p>A white hospital room box. Four walls, counterclockwise from north:</p>
<pre><code>   1. the wall with the window,
   2. the wall with the painting of flowers,
   3. the wall with the door and maybe a little table,
     and
   4. the wall with the patient.
</code></pre><p>Everything else in the entire world is featureless and white.</p>
<p>The patient is awake, and she is hooked up to many important devices. She has my eyes. Her skin is black, the same starlight black as mine. She has my hair, expansive and curly, though it is pulled back by a headband. Her body is beneath a sheet, and may or may not exist.</p>
<p>Beside her sits the mother, who looks just like my mother, and the father, who also looks like mine. They have both been crying. Are currently crying, their faces frozen between joy and grief as tears roll out, like flesh statues in a fountain.</p>
<p>Next to them stands a wrinkled auntie in a white coat. On the other side of the patient, a nurse waits.</p>
<p>But then the box changes all at once, and now the mother is leaning forward and holding the girl, and her shaking vibrates the girl&#39;s frame, and the smell of her vibrates the girl&#39;s brain, and for a moment I am the girl, in the room with smell and many sounds, where movement and bodies are happening now, and breathing is happening now, and mama is holding me, papa is leaning in to hug us both, the doctor beside them is lowering her tablet.</p>
<p>This moment happens several times.</p>
<p>Each time through I think it will be different, but it isn&#39;t. My eyes meet the doctor&#39;s, and they are old and wise and they tell me it&#39;s okay to stay there. I want to, but the body is rolling with sensations, and smells, and its being moved, and it&#39;s all too much, there are too many moments and they just keep happening and I fall off, back to the box.</p>
<p>The little people in the little box are moving now, like they&#39;re alive. The mother is holding the patient. The father has his arm around the mother, his hand squeezing the patient&#39;s leg.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you hear me, Jules?&quot; the doctor asks in her little, far away voice.</p>
<p>Mama sniffles, and the sound happens again and again to the body. There seem to be too many moments, in the body. They are getting jumbled and layering atop one another impossibly.</p>
<p>Mama gently lets me go. She keeps her hands on mine. The little doctor keeps speaking, and the flesh doctor follows her, their words skipping over each other, jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>&quot;You are safe,&quot; they say. They press the surface of the tablet. &quot;Can you try counting for me? Like this: One, two, three...&quot;</p>
<p>One. Two.</p>
<p>I cannot tell if I am saying the words. My breath is somewhere else. I am a contradiction, still flickering, in the room and somewhere far above it.</p>
<p>Three. Four. In the waves, too. I feel their muscles pulsing against mine, alien and old as the sea.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the doctor says, not to me, but to the mother, &quot;Keep touching her arm. Give her something to attach to.&quot;</p>
<p>Six. Seven.</p>
<p>My body comes into focus. Mama is running her fingers up and down my arm. The sensation falls in and out, tickling with intensity and dropping off into numbness.</p>
<p>Eight. </p>
<p>The world slows, jutteringly. I am in the box, then in the body.</p>
<p>Nine.</p>
<p>I am exhaling air, surface air, impossibly heavy in my throat and lungs.</p>
<p>Ten. What&#39;s after ten? Eleven.</p>
<p>The waves of being arrive, again and again, and this time I am not thrown.</p>
<p>I wash upon the shore, and they are moving me.</p>
<p>I wash upon the hospital bed, where I am a puppet, the doctor pulling my strings.</p>
<p>Twelve.</p>
<p>I cough, and it rings in my bones.</p>
<p>I cough again.</p>
<p>And again, and again, trying to expell the sea,
again and again trying to cough up the poison fruit
that has taken over my body</p>
<p>Again and again, coming up dry.</p>
<p>I try until the coughs become laughs, each convulsion the spasm of my mind running over the inescapable, irreconcileable fissure between here and there, between the breathing surface world, and the city of the drowned.</p>
<p>Eons later, the convulsions ebb.</p>
<p>The world is there, and I am in it, and my mother is stroking my arm, and still it&#39;s all so tenuous. My existence, a twisted ankle I&#39;m afraid to put weight on.</p>
<p>The touch is distant, hopping up and down. My throat is distant, but there, and when I move my lips and breathe, words come. They come up crackling, burning like crumpled papers, barely moving the air.</p>
<p>  mama, what&#39;s happening to me?</p>
<p>She can&#39;t speak for a moment, or two or three, and then she says,</p>
<p>&quot;You drowned, baby.&quot;</p>
<p>She takes my hand and holds it tight. The pressure is love, her touch anchoring me to the world. I can feel her pulse through her fingers, each beat sending trickling tremors up my arm.</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#39;re back now.&quot;</p>
<p>  in the ocean?</p>
<p>She nods. </p>
<p>  what happened</p>
<p>&quot;The doctor, she says there&#39;s something wrong in your head.&quot;</p>
<p>Pieces of me come back then. The ocean, calling out.</p>
<p>The feeling washes over me for a moment, and then it&#39;s gone and I cannot even imagine it.</p>
<p>&quot;You went to the beach. Talked to some folks, and they got worried. You weren&#39;t acting right.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m asking a woman where to find the water. She tells me it&#39;ll be cold, and I get offended. I may have screamed at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Like, maybe it was making you feel hot, and you got in the water to try and cool down.&quot;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, there was something down there that I needed to be taught.</p>
<p>I knew it. I felt it with the certainty of the blows of the water.</p>
<p>And now it&#39;s gone. There is a hole where the knowledge once was, and the flesh around it is weak and numb, and the only solid thing is mama&#39;s hand clenching mine like we are the same body, like she will never let me go again.</p>
<p>Papa speaks next. &quot;We saw the news on our feeds. That they&#39;d pulled a body out of the water. Then they called us...&quot; His words are breaking up. He is trying and failing to avoid tears.</p>
<p>   did i die?</p>
<p>My parents don&#39;t have an answer for that.</p>
<p>Or they have an answer and they don&#39;t like it and they can&#39;t bear to speak it.</p>
<p>So the doctor explains.</p>
<p>She does not explain in the half-distracted way doctors have. She does not look at her tablet; she is not wearing Glasses. Her eyes meet mine. Her voice is clear and patient and glows like old wood.</p>
<p>&quot;When you arrived here, you were clinically dead. But these divisions, alive and dead, they are arbitrary. Temporary. The water was very cold, and this protected you.&quot;</p>
<p>  am i still dead?</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; the doctor smiles slightly. &quot;No, you are very much alive now. You are experiencing now the effects of an implant. We put it in to save your life.</p>
<p>&quot;The water you drowned in was very cold. But still, there was damage to your brain. The implant works around the damage. It does what your brain cannot do for itself right now.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take some time to get used to. Things will not feel the same. But your brain is healing. Like a splint, the implant helps to heal it. It shows the brain what to do. There may come a day when you no longer require it.</p>
<p>&quot;But for now, it is keeping you here.</p>
<p>  can i see?</p>
<p>&quot;It might be distressing... Some patients find it difficult to look at.&quot;</p>
<p>I nod faintly. I tell her</p>
<p>  i want to see.</p>
<p>The doctor taps her tablet in a few places, then offers it to me.</p>
<p>I reach out to take it automatically and overshoot, my shaking hands knocking it away from her steady ones and onto my body. It lands with a thud I hear and do not feel.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s okay. Try again. Movement will be challenging for a time.&quot;</p>
<p>I take up an edge of the tablet, and unsteadily flip it over.</p>
<p>On the screen is a brain. My brain. It lights up, scintillating with energy. In another panel, a patchwork 3d model of my face gasps involuntarily, as do I. There is a mannequin of me on the screen, too, startling backwards just before I do. In the last panel, a close up of my hands: my fingers opening up, and splotches of pressure disappearing as the tablet falls.</p>
<p>The screen seems to report my movements not as I do them, but just before. It is more than difficult to look at. It is the sensation of a puppet seeing its strings.</p>
<p>&quot;Try to pick it up,&quot; the doctor says.</p>
<p>I sit up very slowly, the mannequin presaging my movements. I reach forward for the tablet. &quot;Gesture Assist: Pick up object&quot; pops up in little letters on screen.</p>
<p>I pick up the tablet almost automatically. My hands wobble smoothly, tremors resonating in my muscles, shaking with a metallic taste that curls around on my tongue. But I do not drop it. On the screen, my hands are clasped holding an invisible thing, the rendered skin glowing with false heat where the tablet presses on my thumb and fingers. &quot;Gesture Assist: Hold&quot;</p>
<p>I move the tablet around. The movements feel distant and textureless.</p>
<p>In the tablet, my homonculus makes faces at me. It sticks out its tongue. Smiles. Frowns. Single moments later, I make each of these same faces back.</p>
<p>&quot;You are experiencing the puppeteer effect,&quot; the doctor says, &quot;In the brain, the impulse to action precedes awareness of action. The tablet displays your brain&#39;s commands immediately, before even your muscles have had a chance to respond. You see what is happening on screen before you are aware of your own movement or perhaps even your desire to move.&quot;</p>
<p>There are (&quot;Cognitive Assist: Count Objects&quot;) fourteen circles in a ring around my brain at the widest point. They pulse softly. I reach up and there, around my head, is a ring, slightly soft to the touch. It loops all the way around. A loop of the same material hangs lower on my neck, connecting to the Halo behind my ears.</p>
<p>  are these the implants oh god</p>
<p>Just before tumbling from my lips, each word appears on screen. Utterance Assist. In a corner of the screen, my heart rate ratchets. 92 bpm. 108 bpm. The tablet feels shaky.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not used to having such direct insight into what we are doing. It can feel disempowering. Upsetting. Disorienting. But you are the puppeteer, Jules. You are in control.&quot;</p>
<p>I am holding the tablet in one hand. I allow the other to drop. I pick it up again. Watching the arm drop on screen is somehow soothing. The appendage blurs. In freefall, it seems to match my movements, not precede them.</p>
<p>I look up at the doctor, away from the troubling screen, so my words are not prophesied, and I can ask the sickening question without seeing its premonition.</p>
<p>  will i dance again?</p>
