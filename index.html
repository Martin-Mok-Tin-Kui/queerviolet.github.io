      <p>I’m a software engineer with ten years of professional
      experience. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects—everything
      from graphics, to embedded UX, to running massive scale spam
      filtering. I'm a highly capable writer and communicator. I love
      learning and I love teaching. I thrive in environments where I’m
      working closely with other people, either in person or
      remotely.</p>

	<h2>Google, Software Engineer in Site Reliability Engineering</h2>
	<div class="dates">2010 to present</span>
	<p>My team handles the deployment, monitoring, repair, and
	  production tuning of numerous large services at Google.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>I work with developer teams design, document, test, and
	    safely deploy large scale architectural changes.</li>
	  <li>I design monitoring for complex services and developed
	    capacity plans for services running on thousands of
	    machines.</li>
	  <li>I diagnose and repair perplexing issues arising from, for
	    example, the interplay of new code, ancient bugs, and
	    recursive asynchronous processing pipelines.</li>
	  <li>Some weeks, I carry a pager.</li>

	<h2><a href="http://www.noaa.gov">NOAA</a>, Research Scientist</h2>
	<div class="dates">2007 to 2010</div>
	<p>I worked on a projection art museum exhibit
	called <a href="http://sos.noaa.gov">Science on a
	Sphere</a>. It’s a carbon fiber globe six feet in diameter
	that hangs in the center of a dark theater, illuminated by
	four projectors. In terms of physical wow factor, this is the
	coolest project I have ever worked on for money.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>I rebuilt key pieces of the graphics pipeline to be much
	  faster. The efficiency gains let us display video with four
	  times as many pixels as we could before.</li>
	  <li>I helped shrink our hardware footprint from four
	  computers down to one.</li>
	  <li>I added a full Wii remote interface. At the time, this
	  required deep bluetooth hackery.</li>
	  <li>I made the software much nicer to work on and
	  deploy. Before: Makefile maze, environment variables passed
	  down by oral tradition, source in CVS. After: continuous
	  builds and testing, hermetic packages, source—alas—in
	  Subversion.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Medioh, Software Engineer (Intern, Contracting)</h2>
	<div class="dates">2005 to 2007</div>
	<p>While in school, I did an internship and, later, contract
	work for a startup with a variety of video-centric product
	interests.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>As an intern, I worked with two other developers to
	  write a spec and building a reference implementation
	  BitTorrent-like protocol that supported streaming and weak
	  DRM. I wrote the Java client library and applet. I can
	  proudly say that this was the first and last Java applet I
	  ever wrote, and it worked.</li>
	  <li>As a contractor, I worked on the crawler and Ralis
	  frontend for our video search engine.</li>
	  <li>When the company moved towards developing set top box
	  operating system, I worked closely with the design team to
	  implement front end features in a mixture of Javascript and
	  C.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>NOAA, Student Research Assistant</h2>
	<div class="dates">2004 to 2007</div>
	<p>As a student researcher, I worked on a Python framework
	that let weather forecasters write their own tools.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>I ran trainings for forecasters who wanted to learn how
	  to write tools in Python.</li>
	  <li>I handled writing the documentation and numerous sample
	  tools.</li>
	  <li>I added features to the framework, making it possible to
	  perform complex queries on the geospatial database.</li>
	</ul>

      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>In general, I am a fast learner. I can pick up new languages
      and frameworks with ease. Here’s a summary of the technologies

      <h2>I use these every day with delightful alacrity:</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>C++
	<li>Javascript/HTML/CSS/jQuery
	<li>Python
	<li>SQL
	<li>Linux internals and command line
	<li>data visualization ergonomics
	<li>highly scalable software design
	<li>API design
	<li>production monitoring
	<li>capacity planning and performance characterization
      </ul>


      <h2>I’ve used these in the last six months. I’m comfortable with them
      if I have a reference:</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>C
	<li>Go
	<li>Java
	<li>relational database schema design
	<li>Processing / GLSL / OpenGL
      </ul>

      <h2>I’ve used these at some point and I could come up to speed
      in a week or so:</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>Ruby/Rails
	<li>R
	<li>Matlab
	<li>Lisp
	<li>Perl<a class="footnote"><span class="note">I was young. All the cool kids were doing it. I never inhaled.</span></a>
