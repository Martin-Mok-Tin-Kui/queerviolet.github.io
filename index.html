        <h1>Hi, my name is Ashi.</h1>        
          <p>I’m a software engineer with over thirteen years of professional
          experience.</p>          

          <p>I’ve worked on a wide range of projects—everything
          from graphics, to embedded UX, to running massive scale spam
          filtering. I love learning and I love teaching. I thrive in
          environments where I’m working closely with other people, either
          in person or remotely.</p>

          <p>I've been hacking all my life. Here's what I've been up to.</p>

            <h2>Grace Hopper Academy, Instructor</h2>
            <div class="dates">2016 to now</div>
            <p>These days I work as an instructor at Grace Hopper academy, a new coding bootcamp for women run by Fullstack Academy.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It's an all-Javascript curriculum. Even as I've begun to fall for Swift, Javascript is still
                the pacemaker of my heart, so this is an amazing fit.</li>

            <div class="dates">2015 to 2016</div>
            <p>Hopscotch makes a visual programming language for kids for the iPad and, now, the iPhone.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I worked with the CTO and product team to rewrite the code editor as an iPhone app.</li>
              <li>I wrote a ton of Swift and Objective-C. I learned I really like Swift</li>
              <li>I did a lot of work on the web player, a Javascript+WebGL port of the Hopscotch runtime. This involved, amongst other challenges, writing our own text layout system that handles Emojis identically(ish) to how Core Graphics renders them.</li>

            <p>I left full time development to work as an instructor at Dev Bootcamp. Teaching is the most
            powerful and rewarding job I've ever had.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Primarily, I act as a technical lead for students final projects, guiding
              their technical decisions and helping them develop healthy collaboration structures</li>
              <li>I also work as a technical counselor, providing ongoing support and guidance
              to students and alumni as they enter the field.</li>
              <li>I frequently lecture on web technologies&#8212;primarily Javascript and Rails&#8212;and
              computer science fundamentals, and author curriculum on these topics.</li>

            <p>My team handles the deployment, monitoring, repair, and
            production tuning of numerous large services at Google.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I work with developer teams to design, document, test, and
              safely deploy large scale architectural changes.</li>
              <li>I design monitoring for complex services and developed
              capacity plans for services running on thousands of
              machines.</li>
              <li>I diagnose and repair perplexing issues arising from, for
              example, the interplay of new code, ancient bugs, and
              recursive asynchronous processing pipelines.</li>
              <li>Some weeks, I carry a pager.</li>

            Research Scientist</h2>
            <div class="dates">2007 to 2010</div>
            <p>I worked on a projection art museum exhibit
            called <a href="http://sos.noaa.gov">Science on a
            Sphere</a>. It’s a carbon fiber globe six feet in diameter
            that hangs in the center of a dark theater, illuminated by
            four projectors. In terms of physical wow factor, this is the
            coolest project I have ever worked on for money.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I rebuilt key pieces of the graphics pipeline to be much
              faster. The efficiency gains let us display video with four
              times as many pixels as we could before.</li>
              <li>I helped shrink our hardware footprint from four
              computers down to one.</li>
              <li>I added a full Wii remote interface. At the time, this
              required deep bluetooth hackery.</li>
              <li>I made the software much nicer to work on and
              deploy. Before: Makefile maze, environment variables passed
              down by oral tradition, source in CVS. After: continuous
              builds and testing, hermetic packages, source—alas—in
              Subversion.</li>

            work for a startup with a variety of video-centric product
            interests.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As an intern, I worked with two other developers to
              write a spec and building a reference implementation
              BitTorrent-like protocol that supported streaming and weak
              DRM. I wrote the Java client library and applet. I can
              proudly say that this was the first and last Java applet I
              ever wrote, and it worked.</li>
              <li>As a contractor, I worked on the crawler and Ralis
              frontend for our video search engine.</li>
              <li>When the company moved towards developing set top box
              operating system, I worked closely with the design team to

            <ul>
              <li>I ran trainings for forecasters who wanted to learn how
              to write tools in Python.</li>
              <li>I handled writing the documentation and numerous sample
              tools.</li>
              <li>I added features to the framework, making it possible to
