          <h1>Iâ€™ve been hacking for 27 years.</h1>

          <p>Iâ€™ve worked on a wide range of projectsâ€”everything
          from graphics, to embedded UX, to running massive scale spam
          filtering. I love learning and I love teaching. I thrive in
          environments where Iâ€™m working closely with other people, either
          in person or remotely.</p>

          <p>Here's what I've been up to.</p>

              <h2>Grace Hopper Academy, Instructor</h2>
              <p>These days I work as an instructor at Grace Hopper academy, a new coding bootcamp for women run by Fullstack Academy.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>It's an all-Javascript curriculum. Even as I've begun to fall for Swift, Javascript is still
                  the pacemaker of my heart, so this is an amazing fit.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Hopscotch Technologies, Senior Developer</h2>              
              <p>Hopscotch makes a visual programming language for kids for the iPad and, now, the iPhone.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I worked with the CTO and product team to rewrite the code editor as an iPhone app.</li>
                <li>I wrote a ton of Swift and Objective-C. I learned I really like Swift</li>
                <li>I did a lot of work on the web player, a Javascript+WebGL port of the Hopscotch runtime. This involved, amongst other challenges, writing our own text layout system that handles Emojis identically(ish) to how Core Graphics renders them.</li>

              <p>I left full time development to work as an instructor at Dev Bootcamp. Teaching is the most
              powerful and rewarding job I've ever had.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Primarily, I act as a technical lead for students final projects, guiding
                their technical decisions and helping them develop healthy collaboration structures</li>
                <li>I also work as a technical counselor, providing ongoing support and guidance
                to students and alumni as they enter the field.</li>
                <li>I frequently lecture on web technologies&#8212;primarily Javascript and Rails&#8212;and
                computer science fundamentals, and author curriculum on these topics.</li>

              <p>My team handles the deployment, monitoring, repair, and
              production tuning of numerous large services at Google.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I work with developer teams to design, document, test, and
                safely deploy large scale architectural changes.</li>
                <li>I design monitoring for complex services and developed
                capacity plans for services running on thousands of
                machines.</li>
                <li>I diagnose and repair perplexing issues arising from, for
                example, the interplay of new code, ancient bugs, and
                recursive asynchronous processing pipelines.</li>
                <li>Some weeks, I carry a pager.</li>

              Research Scientist</h2>
              <p>I worked on a projection art museum exhibit
              called <a href="http://sos.noaa.gov">Science on a
              Sphere</a>. Itâ€™s a carbon fiber globe six feet in diameter
              that hangs in the center of a dark theater, illuminated by
              four projectors. In terms of physical wow factor, this is the
              coolest project I have ever worked on for money.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I rebuilt key pieces of the graphics pipeline to be much
                faster. The efficiency gains let us display video with four
                times as many pixels as we could before.</li>
                <li>I helped shrink our hardware footprint from four
                computers down to one.</li>
                <li>I added a full Wii remote interface. At the time, this
                required deep bluetooth hackery.</li>
                <li>I made the software much nicer to work on and
                deploy. Before: Makefile maze, environment variables passed
                down by oral tradition, source in CVS. After: continuous
                builds and testing, hermetic packages, sourceâ€”alasâ€”in
                Subversion.</li>

              <p>While in school, I did an internship and, later, contract
              work for a startup with a variety of video-centric product
              interests.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>As an intern, I worked with two other developers to
                write a spec and building a reference implementation
                BitTorrent-like protocol that supported streaming and weak
                DRM. I wrote the Java client library and applet. I can
                proudly say that this was the first and last Java applet I
                ever wrote, and it worked.</li>
                <li>As a contractor, I worked on the crawler and Ralis
                frontend for our video search engine.</li>
                <li>When the company moved towards developing set top box
                operating system, I worked closely with the design team to
                implement front end features in a mixture of Javascript and
                C.</li>

              <p>As a student researcher, I worked on a Python framework
              that let weather forecasters write their own tools.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>I ran trainings for forecasters who wanted to learn how
                to write tools in Python.</li>
                <li>I handled writing the documentation and numerous sample
                tools.</li>
                <li>I added features to the framework, making it possible to
                perform complex queries on the geospatial database.</li>
