    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m a software engineer with ten years of professional experience. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects—everything from graphics, to UX, to running massive scale spam filtering. I love learning and I love teaching. I thrive in environments where I’m working closely with other people, either in person or remotely.</p>
      
    <h1>Experience</h1>

    <h2>Google, Software Engineer in Site Reliability Engineering, 2010—</h2>

My team handles the deployment, monitoring, repair, and production tuning of numerous large services at Google.
I work with developer teams design, document, test, and safely deploy large scale architectural changes.
I design monitoring for complex services and developed capacity plans for services running on thousands of machines.
I diagnose and repair perplexing issues arising from, for example, the interplay of new code, ancient bugs, and recursive asynchronous processing pipelines.
Some weeks, I carry a pager.
Research Scientist, NOAA, 2007 to 2010

I worked on a projection art museum exhibit called Science on a Sphere. It’s a carbon fiber globe six feet in diameter that hangs in the center of a dark theater, illuminated by four projectors. In terms of physical wow factor, this is the coolest project I have ever worked on for money.
I rebuilt key pieces of the graphics pipeline to be much faster. The efficiency gains let us display video with four times as many pixels as we could before.
I helped shrink our hardware footprint from four computers down to one.
I added a full Wii remote interface. At the time, this required deep bluetooth hackery.
I made the software much nicer to work on and deploy. Before: Makefile maze, environment variables passed down by oral tradition, source in CVS. After: continuous builds and testing, hermetic packages, source—alas—in Subversion.
Software Engineer, Medioh, 2005 to 2007

While in school, I did an internship and, later, contract work for a startup with a variety of product interests.
As an intern, I worked with two other developers to write a spec and building a reference implementation BitTorrent-like protocol that supported streaming and weak DRM. I wrote the Java client library and applet. I can proudly say that this was the first and last Java applet I ever wrote, and it worked.
As a contractor, I worked on the crawler and Ralis frontend for our video search engine.
When the company moved towards developing set top box operating system, I worked closely with the design team to implement front end features in a mixture of Javascript and C.
Student Research Assistant, NOAA, 2004 to 2007

As a student researcher, I worked on a Python framework that let weather forecasters write their own tools.
I ran trainings for forecasters who wanted to learn how to write tools in Python.
I handled writing the documentation and numerous sample tools.
I added features to the framework, making it possible to perform complex queries on the geospatial database.
Skills

In general, I am a fast learner. I can pick up new languages and frameworks with ease. Here’s a summary of the technologies I’ve been using recently.
I use these every day with delightful alacrity

C++, Javascript/HTML/CSS/jQuery/etc, Python, SQL, Linux internals and command line, data visualization ergonomics, highly scalable software design, API design, production monitoring, capacity planning, performance characterization.
I’ve used these in the last month. I’m comfortable with them if I have a reference.

C, Go, Java, relational database schema design, Processing and OpenGL.
I’ve used these at some point, and I could come up to speed in a week or so.

Ruby/Rails, R, Matlab, Lisp, Perl[1], PHP[2].
Education

B.S. Computer Science, University of Colorado, 2007.
B.A. English, University of Colorado, 2007.
[1] I was young. All the cool kids were doing it. I never inhaled.
[2] I blame Wordpress.
